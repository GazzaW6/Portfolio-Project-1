            <h2>about us</h2>
            <p>Nestled in the heart of Hoesdspruit, close to the Kruger National Park of South Africa, Njovu Wildlife Photography operates an exclusive wildlife safari and photography experience. With over 20 years of experience between us; myself, Luke and my wife, Zanelle are sure to delight and entertain you whilst guiding you through the most famous nature reserve in South Africa. We have always been passionate about wildlife conservation as well as photography and enjoy sharing our passion for nature with others whilst also providing valuable photography tips and insight.</p>
            <p>Njovu means Elephant in Tsonga and was born out of our true passion for Wildlife and sharing its beauty with everyone around the world. We aim to provide larger than life experiences much like the elephant and it's incredible presence. We pride ourselves on professionalism and always strive to ensure that our guests leave with memories that will last a life time. We will work with you on your camera skills as needed including shooting modes, aperture, shutter speed, ISO; we will also approach our subject matter for each photograph in unique ways to unlock and explore your creativity, we focus on framing, composition and viewpoint in order to provide well balanced photos.</p>

            <h2>what to expect</h2>
            <p>Our package is arranged as a day trip into the Kruger National Park which includes park entrance fees, pickup and drop-off from your hotel as well as guiding you through the park. In addition to photography tips your guides will provide insight and knowledge into the many fascinating flora and fauna species that exist throughout the Kruger National Park. As the park itself is a wildlife reserve, we cannot guarantee sightings but we always endeavour to give you the best possibility to photograph the amazing animals the Kruger National Park has to offer. The list of animals range from the Big 5 such as Elephants, Buffalos, and Rhino; the Small 5 such as Elephant Shrew, Buffalo Weaver and Rhino Beatle; cats such as Lions, Leopards and Servals; smaller animals like the Mongoose or one of the many types of Tortoise; Monkeys; Birds; water Mammals; and the list goes on.</p>
            <p>As some of the best animal sightings tend to occur around sunrise and sunset, conveniently for us photographers, this is also one of the better times to capture photographs as the sun provides some of the best and most beautiful lighting of the day at this time. Thus, our day trip begins at gate opening time (season dependant), and ends at gate closing time (season dependant). The trip also includes drinks throughout the day as well as a lunch tailored to your dietary needs at a picnic spot within the park.</p>
